1. National Instruments
2. PREEMPT_RT is a kernel patch to allow Linux to become a real-time OS
3. Mixed criticality is running muliple operations some of which require RY and others that do not
4. Stack is usually shared between RT and non-RT applications which can cause unexpected behavior
5. Latency between a trigger event and the process actually running
6. Measures the latency after waking from a sleep
7. Comparison of cyclictest latencies between RT and non-RT kernel.
8.
   - Dispatch latency is the amount of time between a hardware trigger and sche$
   - Scheduling latency is amount of time between a scheduler receiving the ins$
9. Mainline is how non-RT systems handle interrupts
10. The non-critical IRQ is currently running and the iterrupt will not be serv$
11. The scheduler is forced to give the small program priority to call the task$
